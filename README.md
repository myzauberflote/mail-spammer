Code to send e-mails through smtplib module

Using Python's smtplib module, we store a collection of e-mails and passwords in a dictionary and, through the random module,
we choose (randomly) an item from the collection and send infinity messages (or until the program stop running).

Note 1: Python 3 needed to work properly.
Note 2: To avoid any authentication error, go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and turn on the option to allow less secure apps.
